## :arrow_forward: How to run?
Since the stable Diffusion Image Inpainting model got taken down from HF, you need to alternatively use the Models provided via Model Scope

1. Download the Stable Diffucion Image Inpainting Model from [ModelScope](https://modelscope.cn/models/AI-ModelScope/stable-diffusion-inpainting/files). 
  
2. Download the FacaDiffy checkpoint from this repository

3. Adjust the paths in Inpainting.ipynb or your own script
